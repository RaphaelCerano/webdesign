<ol>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Put pasta water on to boil</strong></li>
<p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts <br/>
of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a<br/>
large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta<br/>
water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water<br/>
is heating.<br/>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Brown the ground beef</strong></li>
<p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high<br/>
heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned<br/>
on all sides.<br/></p>
<p>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all <br/>
but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Cook the bell pepper, onions garlic, add<br/>
back the beef</strong></li>
<p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet</p>
<p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and<br/>
the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a<br/>
minute more.<p>
<p>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine,<br/>
reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Transfer to medium sized pot, add<br/>
tomatoes and remaining sauce<br/>
ingredients to build the sauce<br/></strong></li>
<p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart)<br/>
pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato<br/>
paste to the pot.<br/>
<p>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the<br/>
amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic<br/>
salt, to taste.</p>
<p>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a<br/>
tablespoon at a time tasting after each addition, to taste. (The<br/>
amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the<br/>
tomatoes are that you are using.)</p>
<p>Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding<br/>
Parmesan, which is salty.</p>
<p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to<br/>
maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring<br/>
often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing<br/>
sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>
<p>Remove from heat.</p>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</strong>
<p>By now the salted water you started hearing in step one should<br/>
be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al<br/>
dente,per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in<br/>
advance.)</p>
<p>Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water<br/>
remains at full rolling boil during the entire cooking to<br/>
prevent noodles from sticking.</p>
<p>When ready,drain in a colander and rinse with cool water,<br/>
gently seperating any noodles that may be sticking together.</p>
<p>Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay<br/>
out the cooked noddles on this sheet, turning them over so<br/>
that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will<br/>
prevent them from sticking together.</p>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Heat the oven to 375°F then assemble the lasagna</strong>
<p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce<br/>
and spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of<br/>
lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may<br/>
overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third<br/>
of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
<p>Sprinkle a layer of a thirf of the grated mozzarella on top of<br/>
lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing<br/>
cheese dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated<br/>
parmesan cheese evenly over the top of ricotta cheese.</p>
<p>Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining<br/>
sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining<br/>
ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.</p>
<p>Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining<br/>
sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the<br/>
remaining Mozzarella cheese.</p>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Bake</strong>
<p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it<br/>
doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45<br/>
minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a<br/>
crusty top or edges.<br/>
<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Cool and serve</strong>
<p>Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers<br/>
will keep for about 5 days. May be reheated in convenional<br/>
oven or microwave. Leave aluminum tent on for storage. (Try<br/>
to a keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</p>
